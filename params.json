These include the Boost C++\r\nlibraries, SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf, OpenGL and tinyxml. You need both\r\nlibrary binaries and header files.\r\n- get the source using git (git clone\r\ngit://github.com/anttisalonen/freekick3.git).\r\n- change to the cloned directory.\r\n- fetch the git submodule by running: git submodule update --init\r\n- to compile, run make.\r\n- to run, use bin/freekick3 (there's no make install yet).\r\n\r\nPlaying\r\n=======\r\n\r\nUse mouse to control the kick direction and keyboard (w/a/s/d) to control\r\nthe run direction. See the in-game help for more information.\r\n\r\nTeams\r\n=====\r\n\r\nFreekick 3 includes some made up teams. If you want to use more realistic\r\nteams, you can either convert Sensible World of Soccer teams to Frekick 3\r\nteams or use football-data-fetcher\r\n(https://github.com/anttisalonen/football-data-fetcher) to fetch team\r\ndata from Wikipedia and convert that data to Freekick 3 teams.\r\n\r\nTo use Sensible World of Soccer teams (PC format), use the utility swos2fk\r\n(compiled using make). Usage:\r\n\r\n  $Â mkdir ~/.freekick/share/teams\r\n  $ bin/swos2fk ~/.freekick3/share/teams/ path/to/swos/PC/Data/TEAM.*\r\n\r\nThis will create the Freekick 3 teams in directory ~/.freekick3/share/teams.\r\n\r\nTo use the data from football-data-fetcher, you can use the script\r\nwikifetcher under src/tools, which will convert the data to Freekick 3\r\nteams. Usage:\r\n\r\n  $ cd src/tools/wikifetcher\r\n  $ python2 wikifetcher.py ordering.txt /path/to/fetcher/output \\\r\n         ~/.freekick3/share/teams\r\n\r\nThe fetcher output path is the directory with subdirectories like UEFA,\r\nCONMEBOL etc.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFor any bug reports, feedback or questions: <ajsalonen at gmail dot com>\r\n\r\nAntti Salonen\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
